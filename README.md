Project: Spring Boot Kafka Microservices with Docker Integration
In this project, I developed a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the power of asynchronous messaging with Apache Kafka. The application consists of two core services:

Producer Service:

Pushes messages to Kafka topics.
Implements an event-caller class to facilitate one-to-one communication between components.
Consumer Service:

Listens to Kafka topics and processes the consumed messages in real-time.
I also configured Kafka in a Docker environment, using a docker-compose YAML file to initialize both the Kafka server and the Kafka UI for easier management and monitoring.

Key technologies used:

Spring Boot: For developing microservices.
Kafka: To enable event-driven architecture.
Docker: For containerization and deployment.
Kafka UI: To monitor and interact with Kafka topics.
This project showcases my ability to design scalable microservices, configure Kafka with Spring Boot, and deploy the solution using Docker.
